# 'puter

Assigns a series of *emotions* to a living AI based on a series of **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**. These **KPIs** are generated via querying infrastructure information across the entire organization.

KPIs will be generated and scripts developed as infrastructure is being procured.

## Methodology

Use Google Cloud Platforrm's **Cloud Shell** to gather a series of scripts to monitor KPIs (i.e., /scripts/puter). The scripts will contain automation that `'puter` will eventually report in a more *human-readable* format.

The contents of these reports can then be generalized and assigned to various emotions, categorically. From there, categories can be translated into animations, resulting in a form of **Artificial Intelligence**, namely `'puter`.

Scripts responsible for scraping data from *The Odds API*.

## Scripts

The scripts are organized across a series of directories.

| Script      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **build** | Scripts responsible for aspects of the CICD process. |
| **sports-game-odds** | Scripts scraping data from *Sports Game Odds*. |
| **the-odds-api** | Scripts scraping data from *The Odds API*. |
